# SecPyRender

A simple secure framework that associate a python object with a html framework to render it

All the critical field of the user defined object can be automatically encrypted and save to online mongodb database (mongodb atlas) and decrypted after pulling from the database.

The SecPyRender can deal with simple component oriented development. No double binding since there exist an encryption layer. 

Javascript is currently not supported, but it is possible in the futher although the javascript is not that intuitive under a python based framework.

Feel free to further develop this naive framework and play around with it. It allows python programmer to play around with there data easily.
